Copyright is dead.  Copyright remains dead, and we have killed it.  How
shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?  What was
holiest and mightiest of all that the world of censorship has yet owned has
bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?  What
water is there for us to clean ourselves?  What festivals of atonement,
what sacred games shall we have to invent?  Is not the greatness of this
deed too great for us?  Must we ourselves not become authors simply to
appear worthy of it?
